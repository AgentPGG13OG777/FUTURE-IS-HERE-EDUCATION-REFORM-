Examples of successful implementation of exciting and fun strategies in other schools:

1. Flipped classroom: In a flipped classroom, students watch video lectures or read materials at home, and then come to class to work on projects or engage in discussions. This approach can be more engaging for students, as they have more control over their learning and can work at their own pace.

2. Service learning: Service learning involves giving students the opportunity to apply what they're learning in the classroom to real-world problems in their community. For example, students might work with a local non-profit organization to address a social issue like homelessness or hunger.

3. Outdoor education: Some schools are incorporating outdoor education into their curriculum to help students connect with nature and learn important skills like teamwork and problem-solving. This might involve taking students on camping trips, nature walks, or other outdoor activities.

Advice for incorporating these strategies into the new education policy:

1. Start with a clear vision: Before implementing any new strategies, it's important to have a clear vision of what you want to achieve. What are your goals for student learning and engagement? How will these strategies help you achieve those goals?

2. Involve stakeholders: It's important to involve all stakeholders in the process of implementing new strategies, including teachers, students, parents, and community members. Make sure everyone understands the benefits of these strategies and is invested in their success.

3. Provide resources and support: Teachers will need resources and support to effectively implement these new strategies. This might include professional development opportunities, access to technology and other resources, and support from administrators and other staff.

4. Monitor and evaluate: Finally, it's important to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these new strategies. Collect data on student engagement and learning outcomes, and use that data to make adjustments and improvements as needed.
